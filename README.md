A project to create a chat for 2 users.
The user can register using email or phone number.

To build the client side of the app, we will use HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The frameworks for web apps include React or Angular and the server-side language will be Node.js.
We want our front-end infrastructure to communicate over a WebSocket protocol with our server so we can communicate in real-time between two client applications.
